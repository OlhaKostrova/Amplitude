Analysis of the Users Cohort who performed the Welcome action for the first time during June 2023 | Project Media Streaming - Analytics

First of all, a cohort of users was created for this project, with the following parameters:
- Country: USA
- Platform: iOS and Android
- Using the historical count, select the users who performed the 'Welcome' action for the first time during June 2023. 

The number of users who performed the 'Welcome' action for the first time during June 2023 was 64,049 users.

Based on this cohort, I created the following visualisations:

- User onboarding funnel in the order 'Welcome' - 'User Sign Up' - 'Main Landing Screen' - 'Search Song or Video' - 'Play Song or Video', segmented by platforms iOS and Android.
From this funnel, you can see that more than half of the users who performed the 'Welcome' action for the first time performed the 'Play Song or Video' action, so the conversion to the 'Play Song or Video' action on the iOS platform was 52.3% and 59% on the Android platform.

Conversion Rates:
- iOS: 52.3% completed the onboarding funnel to 'Play Song or Video.'
- Android: 59% completed the onboarding funnel to 'Play Song or Video.'

- Line graph comparing conversion to onboarding funnel passage per day by iOS and Android platforms.
This graph clearly shows a drop in conversion from the onboarding funnel on weekends, especially significant drop in conversions on 20â€“30% on Saturdays.

- Line graph showing the time it has taken for a user to complete an onboarding day by iOS and Android platforms.
Where you can also trace the pattern of decreasing onboarding funnel time on weekends.
It may be assumed that the time it takes users to go through the onboarding funnel is reduced because users have more free time to go through onboarding than on weekdays.

- Explored the dynamics of changes in the number of users who perform 'Play Song or Video' and users who perform 'Any Active event' per day.

- Investigated the average number of events per user per day: 'Any ctive event' and 'Play Song or Video'.
This graph shows the dynamics of the number of events per user per day. Both metrics show a drop in activity during weekends despite faster onboarding completion.
Despite the fact that users spend less time onboarding on weekends, they also interact with the product less on weekend days.

- The Bar Chart shows the Retention of users from the 'Welcome' event to 'Any Active event' and 'Play Song or Video' indicates what percentage of users returned and performed Any Actine Event or Play Song or Video again.
By the end of the month, Metrics:
- Retention from 'Welcome' to 'Any Active Event': 37.3%.
- Retention from 'Welcome' to 'Play Song or Video': 37.1%.

In conclusion, the Retention rates are promising, indicating users are consistently engaging with the platform., and indicates that users are indeed retained.

Key Insights:

- Positive growth: Significant increases in user activity and engagement over the month.
- Retention: Strong retention rates reflect effective onboarding and platform stickiness.

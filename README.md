Analysis of the Users Cohort who performed the Welcome action for the first time during June 2023 | Project Media Streaming - Analytics

First of all, a cohort of users was created for this project, with the following parameters:
Country: USA
Platform: iOS or Android
Using the historical count, select the users who performed the 'Welcome' action for the first time during June 2023. 

The number of users who performed the 'Welcome' action for the first time during June 2023 was 64,049 users.

Based on this cohort, I created the following visualisations:

- User onboarding funnel in the order Welcome - User Sign Up - Main Landing Screen - Search Song or Video - Play Song or Video, segmented by platforms iOS and Android.
From this funnel, you can see that more than half of the users who performed the 'Welcome' action for the first time performed the 'Play Song or Video' action, so the conversion to the 'Play Song or Video' action on the iOS platform was 52.3% and 59% on the Android platform.

- Line graph comparing conversion to onboarding funnel passage per day by iOS and Android platforms.
This graph clearly shows a drop in conversion from the onboarding funnel on weekends, especially on Saturdays, on 20 - 30 %.

- Line graph showing the time it has taken for a user to complete an onboarding day by iOS and Android platforms.
Where you can also trace the pattern of decreasing onboarding funnel time on weekends.

It may be assumed that the time it takes users to go through the onboarding funnel is reduced because users have more free time to go through onboarding than on weekdays.

- Explored the dynamics of changes in the number of users who play Play Song or Video and users who play any active event per day.

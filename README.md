Analysis of the Users Cohort who performed the Welcome action for the first time during June 2023 | Project Media Streaming - Analytics

First of all, a cohort of users was created for this project, with the following parameters:
Country: USA
Platform: iOS or Android
Using the historical count, select the users who performed the 'Welcome' action for the first time during June 2023. 

The number of users who performed the 'Welcome' action for the first time during June 2023 was 64,049 users.

Based on this cohort, I created the following visualisations:

- User onboarding funnel in the order 'Welcome' - 'User Sign Up' - 'Main Landing Screen' - 'Search Song or Video' - 'Play Song or Video', segmented by platforms iOS and Android.
From this funnel, you can see that more than half of the users who performed the 'Welcome' action for the first time performed the 'Play Song or Video' action, so the conversion to the 'Play Song or Video' action on the iOS platform was 52.3% and 59% on the Android platform.

- Line graph comparing conversion to onboarding funnel passage per day by iOS and Android platforms.
This graph clearly shows a drop in conversion from the onboarding funnel on weekends, especially on Saturdays, on 20 - 30 %.

- Line graph showing the time it has taken for a user to complete an onboarding day by iOS and Android platforms.
Where you can also trace the pattern of decreasing onboarding funnel time on weekends.
It may be assumed that the time it takes users to go through the onboarding funnel is reduced because users have more free time to go through onboarding than on weekdays.

- Explored the dynamics of changes in the number of users who perform 'Play Song or Video' and users who perform 'Any Active event' per day.
This graph shows a positive trend in the number of users who perform 'Play Song or Video' and users who perform 'Any Active event'.
The number of users who performed 'Any Active event' from 1 June to 30 June increased by 33.2k, which is 1000%, and the number of users who performed 'Play Song or Video' during the same period increased by 29.1k, which is 1000%.

- Investigated the average number of events per user per day: 'Any ctive event' and 'Play Song or Video'.
This graph shows the dynamics of the number of events per user per day. On weekends, the dynamics of the drop in user activity, both for 'Any Active event' and for 'Play Song or Video'.
Despite the fact that users spend less time onboarding on weekends, they also interact with the product less on weekend days.

- The Bar Chart shows the Retention of users from the 'Welcome' event to 'Any Active event' and 'Play Song or Video' indicates what percentage of users returned and performed Any Actine Event or Play Song or Video again.
By the end of the month, it can be seen that the Retention for 'Any Active event' is 37.3%, and the Retention for 'Play Song or Video' is 37.1%.
In conclusion, the retention rate is quite good, as it is not close to zero, and indicates that users are indeed retained.
